Unlocking Societal Trends in Aadhaar Enrollment and
Updates
Data Analysis, Visualization, and Anomaly Detection
Team Analysis
January 20, 2026
1 Problem Statement
The Aadhaar system, one of the world’s largest biometric identification databases, has matured from
primarily new enrollments to a complex ecosystem of demographic updates, biometric refreshes, and
residual enrollments. The core challenge is to identify meaningful patterns, trends, and anomalies
within massive, fragmented Aadhaar datasets to translate raw data into actionable insights for informed
decision-making. Specifically, the analysis addresses:
•Understanding temporal and geographic patterns in enrollment and update activities
•Detecting anomalies in data distribution across age groups and regions
•Investigating unexpected adult enrollment patterns (age 18+) in a saturated market
•Identifying correlation between enrollment activities and geographic factors such as border regions
2 Proposed Technical and Analytical Approach
The analysis employs a three-phase methodology:
2.1 Phase 1: Data Engineering
Establishes a robust pipeline to consolidate and prepare data:
•Dynamic file detection: Merges fragmented CSV files into unified master datasets using Pandas
•De-duplication: Removes exact duplicates to prevent skewed analysis
•Entity resolution: Standardizes state name variations to official nomenclature
•Date standardization: Converts all dates to ISO 8601 format for consistent time-series analysis
•Logical sorting: Implements nested sorting (date→→ßstateß→ßdistrict)usingstablemerge−
sortfortime−ordered, geographicallystandardizeddata
2.2 Phase 2: Exploratory Visualization
Generates comprehensive visualizations to establish baseline trends:
•Analyzes biometric updates through temporal trends and age group distributions
•Examines demographic updates across daily patterns
•Investigates enrollment data by age categories and temporal variations
•Performs trilateral analysis using radar charts and normalized heatmaps
•Identifies top-performing states across all three categories (biometric updates, demographic updates,
new enrollments)
2.3 Phase 3: Targeted Case Study
Focuses on anomaly investigation using specialized geospatial algorithms:
•Anomaly detection: Identifies persistent 3
•Geospatial analysis: Develops custom Python module (indiaenroll.py) for granular district and
pin-code level analysis
•Hotspot identification: Isolates geographic concentrations of adult enrollments
•Correlation analysis: Investigates relationship between adult enrollments and international border
regions (Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan borders)

Dataset Description
Data Sources
The analysis utilizes Aadhaar transaction data provided in multiple fragmented CSV files. These files
contain records of three primary transaction types:
•Biometric Updates: Records of biometric information refreshes
•Demographic Updates: Records of demographic information modifications
•New Enrollments: Records of new Aadhaar registrations
Dataset Structure
The consolidated dataset contains the following key columns:
Column Name Data Type Description
Date Date Transaction date in DD-MM-YYYY format (standardized to ISO 8601: YYYY-MM-DD)
State String Name of the state where transaction occurred (standardized to official nomenclature)
District String Name of the district where transaction occurred
Pin Code Integer Six-digit postal code identifying specific geographic location
Age Group Categorical Classification of enrollee/updater age (0-5, 5-17, 18+)
Transaction Type Categorical Type of transaction (Biometric Update, Demographic Update, New Enrollment)
Count Integer Number of transactions for the given combination of attributes
Data Quality and Preprocessing
Data Quality Issues Addressed
The raw datasets exhibited several quality issues that required preprocessing:
•Fragmentation: Data scattered across multiple CSV files requiring consolidation
•Duplicate Records: Exact duplicate entries that could skew aggregate counts
•Inconsistent Naming: State names with variations (e.g., “Orissa” vs. “Odisha”, “Uttaranchal”
vs. “Uttarakhand”)
•Date Format Variations: Multiple date formats requiring standardization
•Missing Values: Incomplete records requiring validation and handling
Data Volume
•Total Records Analyzed: 3,971,882 records after de-duplication
•Time Period Covered: 2025-03-01 to 2025-12-31
•Geographic Coverage: All 36 states and union territories of India
•Total Biometric Updates: 1,766,212
•Total Demographic Updates: 1,222,598
•Total New Enrollments: 983,072
Data Limitations
•Dataset represents aggregated transaction counts rather than individual-level records
•Age groups are categorical rather than precise ages
•Geographic granularity limited to district and pin code level
•Temporal resolution is daily, not capturing intraday patterns
3 Methodology and Analytical Framework
Our analysis followed three distinct phases:
1.Data Engineering:Established a pipeline to merge, clean, and sort fragmented datasets, address-
ing inconsistencies and ensuring time-ordered, geographically standardized data.
2.Exploratory Visualization:Generated comprehensive visualizations to establish baseline trends.

The enrollment age distribution revealed a critical anomaly: a persistent 3% segment of adult
enrollments (age 18+) in a saturated market.
3.Targeted Case Study:This observation triggered focused investigation using specialized geospa-
tial algorithms to trace adult enrollments, identifying border-region hotspots as primary drivers.
3.1 Data Aggregation
Raw data was provided in multiple fragmented CSV files. We used dynamic file-detection to consolidate
them into unified master files using Pandas.
1import glob , pandas as pd , os
2
3csv_files = glob . glob (os. path . join ( input_dir , ’*. csv ’))
4if not csv_files :
5print ("No CSV files found !")
6
7dfs = [pd. read_csv (f) for f in csv_files ]
8df = pd. concat (dfs , ignore_index = True )
Listing 1: Dynamic merging of fragmented datasets
3.2 Data Cleaning and Standardization
The merged data contained duplicates, inconsistent state names, and varying date formats. Key trans-
formations included:
•De-duplication:Removed exact duplicates to prevent skewed counts
•Entity resolution:Mapped state name variations to official titles
•Date standardization:Converted all dates to ISO 8601 format
1STATE_MAPPING = {’orissa ’: ’Odisha ’, ’uttaranchal ’: ’Uttarakhand ’}
2
3def standardize_state ( state_value ):
4state_lower = str ( state_value ). strip (). lower ()
5return STATE_MAPPING .get ( state_lower , ’INVALID ’)
6
7df[’state ’] = df[’state ’]. apply ( standardize_state )
8df[’date ’] = pd. to_datetime (df[’date ’], format =’%d -%m -%Y’,
9errors =’coerce ’). strftime (’%Y -%m -%d’)
Listing 2: Standardization and validation logic
3.3 Logical Sorting
For time-series analysis, we applied nested sorting: date→state→district using stable merge-sort.
1df. sort_values (by =[" date ", " state ", " district "],
2ascending =[ True , True , True ],
3inplace =True , kind =" mergesort ")
Listing 3: Nested sorting for time-series analysis

Analysis was divided into modules exploring individual trends, pairwise relationships, and holistic
patterns.

5 Case Study: Adult Enrollment Anomalies
6 Case Study: Adult Enrollment Anomalies
6.1 Observation and Hypothesis
A national-level pie chart of enrollment distribution by age group reveals a clear anomaly: only3.1%
of new enrollments are adults (age 18+), while 65.2% are children aged 0–5 and 31.7% are aged 5–17
(Figure 13).
Given near-universal Aadhaar saturation among adults in India (officially>99%), such a low propor-
tion of adult enrollments is highly unexpected under normal demographic patterns. We hypothesized
that this small but significant adult segment is not randomly distributed but heavily concentrated in
geographic hotspots, particularly along India’s international borders.
Figure 13: National Enrollment Distribution by Age Group
6.2 Methodology
We conducted granular spatiotemporal analysis using custom visualization tools, isolating theage 18greater
metric to map enrollment volumes at state, district, and pin-code levels, identify peak dates, and detect
hotspots through heatmaps, state pop-ups, and radar views.
6.3 Border-Level Radar Analysis
The border radar view (bubble map) provides a focused visualization of total enrollment activity con-
centrated along India’s international borders. Large red bubbles highlight districts with exceptionally
high volumes, overwhelmingly located in border states:
•Uttar Pradesh: Massive bubble over Bahraich district (Total Activity 101,003, pin-code 271865
highlighted)
•Bihar: Very large bubble in northern border districts (e.g., Sitamarhi region)
•West Bengal: Prominent activity in northern and eastern border areas
•Smaller but significant bubbles in northeastern states (Assam, Meghalaya) and western borders
(Punjab, Gujarat)
This radar view confirms that the highest enrollment volumes — both total and disproportionately
adult — are clustered in sensitive border zones (Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, and Myanmar borders).
The size and density of bubbles underscore that border regions drive the national anomaly, with interior
states showing minimal or no activity.

6.4 State-Level Analysis
Geospatial heatmaps and state pop-ups reveal pronounced adult enrollment spikes in specific border
states, with synchronized peaks on2025-07-01across most hotspots — indicating coordinated activity
rather than organic growth.
Key state-level observations:
•Meghalaya: Highest adult volume (35,078) despite smaller population; hotspot in West Khasi Hills
near Bangladesh border
•Assam: 22,555 adults; hotspot in Darrang district
•Uttar Pradesh: 17,699 adults; concentrated in Nepal-border districts (Bahraich, Moradabad)
•Bihar: 11,799 adults; hotspot in Sitamarhi near Nepal border
•West Bengal: 8,495 adults; activity in northern border districts
Non-border states show pale colors and negligible adult enrollments, reinforcing the border-specific
nature of the anomaly.

6.5 State-Level Comprehensive Analysis
The full state-wise breakdown (Table 2) confirms that adult enrollments are disproportionately high in
border states, with Meghalaya, Assam, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, and Bihar leading. Non-border states
show significantly lower adult shares.

6.6 Conclusion
The combined evidence from radar views and state-level analysis strongly indicates that adult Aadhaar
enrollments, though only 3.1% nationally, are driven by border-specific factors — likely migration
regularization or targeted demographic updates — rather than standard population growth.
This analysis strongly indicates that the observed adult enrollments are primarily driven bymigration
regularization, border-area demographic updates, or coordinated enrollment campaigns,
rather than standard organic growth expected from natural population increase.
